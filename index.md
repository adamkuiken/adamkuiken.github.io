### Experience
I have completed two internships. My first internship was a the Regenstein Foundation Center for Bionic Medicine at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago, IL. The second was at the Institute For Human and Machine Cognition.

### Shirley Ryan AbilityLab
I developed an Augmented Reality visualization program for prosthesis training of amputees. The program was developed for a Microsoft Hololens, using Unity 3DEngine and C# and Python Programming languages. 
```markdown
**My Tasks:**
- Integrate the in-house EMG sensor band with the Simulation Engine
- Create the Augmented Reality simulation in Unity
- Track the user's arm in realtime and overlay the prosthetic model using the Hololens
- Create Dynamic models using the sensor input

**Results:**
I created the simulation in which the user was able to see a digital model of an arm or prosthesis that moved with the user's arm in realtime.
```

### Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC)
I created a Virtual Relaity, multi-user, robotic control simulation. I used the Unity 3D Engine, ROS, C#, and principles of physics and mechanics to develop said simulation.
```markdown
**Experience Gained**
- Unity Robotics 
- Networking Physics and Multilevel Networking
- Robotic Operating System (ROS)
- Robotic and mechanical principles of physics
- Virtual reality application development

**My Tasks:**
- Work with a team of multidisciplinary engineers to integrate simulation with physical prototyping
- Develop the simulation with precise physics
- Iterate on the static simulation to implement virtual reality control of robotics
- Iterate further to develop multi-user simulation

**Results**
I completed building the simulation with the aforementioned specifications as well as documented my process for abstraction and further development.

### [Stock and Cryptocurrency Analysis](https://github.com/adamkuiken/Stock_Crypto_Analysis)
I built a [ coinmarketcap.com webscrapper](https://github.com/adamkuiken/CryptoScrapper) that compiled daily open,close,volume,high, and low values for 1year, of all of the coins that were tradeable on coinbase. Then I performed various statistical analysis and machine learning models to the data to find trading patterns. 

### [DNA Machine Learning Analysis](https://github.com/adamkuiken/Analysis-of-DNA-damage)
I used various machine learning models to analyze genetic data in order to predict cancer in smokers. The data was collected from [The Cancer Genome Atlas Program](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga).

### [Fusion360 Pattern Script](https://github.com/adamkuiken/Fusion360-pattern-Script)
I am in the process of developing an add-on for fusion360 that creates a volumetric patterned cut through an object. This can be used to optimize development workflows in the additive manufacturing industry, as well as others. 

For example, if one would like to model flooring wiht a specific til pattern, this tool would be able to take the models of the flooring and cut the pattern of the tiles into the flooring, thus making it simple to calculate the number of tiles and other necessary metrics.
