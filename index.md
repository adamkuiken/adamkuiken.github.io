### Summary
Experienced in leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive innovation in both physical and virtual environments, with a background spanning from Augmented Reality to Machine Learning. During internships at prestigious institutions such as the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab and the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, I honed my skills in simulation development, robotics control, and virtual reality application design. At the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, I spearheaded the creation of an Augmented Reality program utilizing Unity 3D Engine and C# to aid in prosthesis training for amputees, achieving real-time synchronization between the user's movements and digital models. Moreover, at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, I developed a Virtual Reality simulation for multi-user robotic control, employing Unity, ROS, and principles of physics to deliver a precise and immersive real-time experience.

I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at The Pennsylvania State University. During my time there, I honed my skills in programming and data analytics through a variety of different technological applications. In my capstone project, I created a website for documenting sustainable architecture standards for Building Vitality LLC. I used various machine-learning models to analyze genetic data to predict cancer in smokers, utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program. I also worked as a student consultant for a start-up, in Nairobi, Kenya, called Ukwenza VR. On this project, I built a Virtual Reality educational app to foster environmental conservation awareness among children.

Transitioning to enVista Corporation as a Software Consultant, I expanded my expertise in client-focused design and development, alongside building machine learning and artificial intelligence models for business optimization. My contributions included developing reports with Power BI for data analysis, implementing AI solutions to automate processes, and creating machine learning models for enhanced decision-making. Demonstrating strong project leadership, I successfully led numerous initiatives in data migrations, database upgrades, and the deployment of advanced AI systems, driving tangible improvements in operational efficiency and business outcomes.
