### Experience
I have completed two internships. My first internship was a the Regenstein Foundation Center for Bionic Medicine at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago, IL. The second was at the Institute For Human and Machine Cognition.

### Shirley Ryan AbilityLab
I developed an Augmented Reality visualization program for prosthesis training of amputees. The program was developed for a Microsoft Hololens, using Unity 3DEngine and C# and Python Programming languages. 
```markdown
**My Tasks:**
- Integrate the in-house EMG sensor band with the Simulation Engine
- Create the Augmented Reality simulation in Unity
- Track the user's arm in realtime and overlay the prosthetic model using the Hololens
- Create Dynamic models using the sensor input

**Results:**
I created the simulation in which the user was able to see a digital model of an arm or prosthesis that moved with the user's arm in realtime.
```

### Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC)
I created a Virtual Relaity, multi-user, robotic control simulation. I used the Unity 3D Engine, ROS, C#, and principles of physics and mechanics to develop said simulation.
```markdown
**Experience Gained**
- Unity Robotics 
- Networking Physics and Multilevel Networking
- Robotic Operating System (ROS)
- Robotic and mechanical principles of physics
- Virtual reality application development

**My Tasks:**
- Work with a team of multidisciplinary engineers to integrate simulation with physical prototyping
- Develop the simulation with precise physics
- Iterate on the static simulation to implement virtual reality control of robotics
- Iterate further to develop multi-user simulation

**Results**
I completed building the simulation with the aforementioned specifications as well as documented my process for abstraction and further development.
